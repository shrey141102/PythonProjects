## Rock Paper Scissors

# Instructions

Make a rock, paper, scissors game. 

Inside the `main.py` file, you'll find the ASCII art for the hand signals already saved to a corresponding variable: `rock`, `paper`, and `scissors`. This will make it easy to print them out to the console. 

Start the game by asking the player:

*"What do you choose? Press the 'Rock' Button for Rock, ''Paper' for Paper or 'Scissors' Button for Scissors."*

From there you will need to figure out: 
* How you will store the user's input.
* How you will generate a random choice for the computer.
* How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
* And also how you will give feedback to the player. 

You can find the "official" rules of the game on [the World Rock Paper Scissors Association website.](https://wrpsa.com/the-official-rules-of-rock-paper-scissors/)

# Bugs fixed : 
1. The code didn't generate random values when user wished for a replay and also the code didn't take the user's 'replay-input'. Fixed it.
2. Added more user interactive code at the bottom which facilitates for more clarity to the user while replay
3. Fixed few lines for proper termination of the game by asking the user's input itself i.e asking to press 'n' for the play to end.
4. Fixed the GUI of the game.
5. Added Continuity to the game.
